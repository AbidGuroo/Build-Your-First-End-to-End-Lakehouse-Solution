## 15. Adjust default pool size to 2 nodes

To ensure smooth operation for multiple concurrent workshops happening today, you need to adjust the default configuration of the compute cluster in your Fabric workspace to scale down the maximum number of nodes to 2.

> [!NOTE]  
>  This task is crucial for optimizing resource usage and ensuring that the workshops run smoothly for all participants. By reducing the maximum number of nodes to 2, you help manage the load on the system and improve the experience for everyone involved.


1. **Navigate to Workspace Settings**:
   - Confirm that you are within the correct workspace view.
   - Access the workspace settings as indicated in the Fabric UI.

2. **Modify Default Pool Configuration**:
   - Go to Data Engineering / Data Science (it's under PowerBI) -> and then click on Spark settings. 
   - Locate the "default pool for workspace" setting.
   - Click on the pencil icon (marked as "1" in the provided screenshot) to edit the pool settings.

3. **Adjust Autoscale Settings and Save Changes**:
   - In the default pool configuration, change the autoscale maximum setting from 10 to 2. This limits the maximum number of nodes to 2 to prevent resource over-allocation.
   - Confirm and save your modifications to the default pool settings.
