# Build Your First End to End Lakehouse Solution

> [!NOTE]
> Sunday, March 24, Workshop Hours: 9 am â€“ 4 pm PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)

Join our workshop to master building end-to-end data solutions with Microsoft Fabric. Learn to integrate, transform, and manage data in a lakehouse, utilizing Fabric pipelines, dataflows, notebooks, and Spark. Understand how BI analysts and data scientists utilize lakehouse data to enhance decision-making.

**Workshop Goals**
- Master Fabric Data Integration and Data Engineering and Data Science.
- Develop a complete data workflow: ingestion, preparation, serving, and operationalization.

**Project Context: Urban Mobility Transformation**
- Use Microsoft Fabric to analyze New York City's taxi data for improved urban planning and transportation safety.
- Aim: Better traffic forecasting, route management, and safety measures, leading to enhanced urban transport services and infrastructure.

**Lakehouse Solution Benefits**
- Unified urban transport data analysis.
- Enhanced fleet management and traffic forecasting.
- Data-driven urban development insights.
- Improved transportation reliability and safety.
- Adaptable data infrastructure for future urban mobility trends.
