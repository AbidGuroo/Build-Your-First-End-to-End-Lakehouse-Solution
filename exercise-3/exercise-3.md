# Context

Microsoft Fabric provides Data Science experiences that enable users to perform comprehensive data science workflows. These workflows cover the entire data science process, from data exploration and preparation to experimentation, modeling, model scoring, and serving predictive insights in Power BI Reports. In Fabric each step of the Data Science process is powered by both native built features like Data Wrangler, NotebookUtils, MLFlow, SynapseML, Copilot, PowerBI etc. in addition to numerous open-source libraries enabling a Data Scientist to built a machine learning solution. The below diagram outlines an end-to-end Data Science process and the Fabric features relevant to the process.

![End-to-End Data Science](../screenshots/4/EndtoEndDataScience.png)


The data in your lakehouse tables is included in a dataset that defines a relational model for your data. You can edit this dataset, defining custom measures, hierarchies, aggregations, and other elements of a data model. You can then use the dataset as the source for a Power BI report that enables you to visualize and analyze the data.

You can leverage the **DirectLake** feature to create Power BI datasets directly on top of your data stored in the Lakehouse. DirectLake enhances query performance when dealing with large data volumes and seamlessly integrates with Lakehouse workloads that read and write Parquet files. By combining the data visualization capabilities of Power BI with the centralized storage and tabular schema of a data lakehouse, you can implement an end-to-end analytics solution on a single platform.

**Fabric enables you to visualize** the results of a single query or your entire data warehouse, **without leaving the data warehouse experience**. Exploring data while you work to ensure you have all the necessary data and transformations for your analysis is particularly useful.

Use the **Visualize button** to create a new Power BI report from the results of your query. Creating a new report with the results of your query will open a Power BI window.

You can also use the **New report button** to create a new Power BI report from the contents of your entire data warehouse. Using the New report button opens the Power BI service experience where you can build and save your report for use by the business.

# DirectLake vs DirectQuery in Power BI

Power BI is natively integrated in the whole Fabric experience. This native integration brings a unique mode, called DirectLake, of accessing the data from the lakehouse to provide the most performant query and reporting experience. DirectLake mode is a groundbreaking new engine capability to analyze very large datasets in Power BI. The technology is based on the idea of loading parquet-formatted files directly from a data lake without having to query a data warehouse or lakehouse endpoint, and without having to import or duplicate data into a Power BI dataset. DirectLake is a fast path to load the data from the data lake straight into the Power BI engine, ready for analysis.

![Direct Lake Super Power](https://microsoft.github.io/fabricnotes/images/notes/14-direct-lake.png)

In traditional DirectQuery mode, the Power BI engine queries the data directly from the data source every time it's queried and hence query performance depends on the speed data can be retrieved from the data source. This method avoids having to copy the data; any changes at the source are immediately reflected in the query results while in the import mode. And yet performance is better because the data is readily available in memory without having to query the data source each time. However, the Power BI engine must first copy the data into the dataset at refresh time. Any changes at the source are only picked up during the next data refresh.

DirectLake mode now eliminates this import requirement by loading the data files directly into memory. Because there's no explicit import process, it's possible to pick up any changes at the source as they occur, thus combining the advantages of DirectQuery and import mode while avoiding their disadvantages. DirectLake mode is therefore the ideal choice for analyzing very large datasets and datasets with frequent updates at the source.

# Task 3.2 Explore and Visualize Taxi Trip Data Using Power BI and Direct Lake

In this exercise, you will explore and visualize taxi trip data, including the predicted trip durations from the machine learning model you developed in Task 3.1. You will use Microsoft Fabric's Semantic Model and Direct Lake feature for direct connectivity and create a Power BI report to analyze the data. Semantic models in Fabric represent a source of data that's ready for reporting and visualization, and exist as an abstraction layer that translates complex data models into an understandable format.

### Steps to Follow

1. **Access the Lakehouse Artifact**:
   - Navigate to the "goldcurated" lakehouse artifact within your workspace, used in previous exercises.
   - Open the lakehouse UI to begin working with the data.

2. **Create a New Semantic Model**:
   - Click the "New semantic model" button on the top ribbon.
   - In the dialog, name the semantic model (e.g., NYCTaxiTrips), expand the 'dbo' schema and select **greentaxi_predicted** under 'Tables' as the data source. Confirm to create the semantic model linked to your predictive data.
